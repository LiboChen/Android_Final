APT Android Demo

This code is a simple demostration of uploading images to Google's App Engine storage and displaying the images using your Android phone.

The Backend folder shows how I set up the backend in Python.

The AndroidDemo folder contains all the Android Code.

HelloWorld.zip is a simplier Android demo made by Raga in 2014.
